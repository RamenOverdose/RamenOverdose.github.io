	<blockquote>This is my page for all things automotive. I have been photographing cars for as long as I can remember, and have<br>
				seen almost everything, from Japanese imports to Italian supercars. I cannot tell you how blessed I am to be able<br>
				to pursue both of my passions in my career, and am always on the lookout for the next big car show. I hope you<br>
				enjoy my images, and as always, here's to burning rubber and clicking shutters.
