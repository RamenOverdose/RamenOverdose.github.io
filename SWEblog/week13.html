    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      This past week I finished up my Computer Vision assignment, which took more time than I expected. It involved running
      machine learning algorithms on the CIFER dataset, which consists of 50,000 images. This meant that each run of the
      program took hours to complete, which greatly hindered my progress throughout the assignment. I also underestimated
      the amount of coding required, so I was working until Friday night. Our SWE group also began working on the last
      phase of the website. We have not done much, but we have an idea of what needs to be completed. <br><br>

      On Wednesday I registered for classes. I was able to register at a decent time but was still unable to get all
      the classes I wanted. I'm pretty upset that some popular classes do not have more sections. So far I've added
      myself to three waitlists.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      We have quite a bit to do for this phase of the project. We're presenting on Friday, which is only a day after this
      phase is due. We need to complete six visualizations by then. We also really want our site to be eye-catching. <br><br>

      On the last week of school I have four exams, which are basically my finals. I'm not looking forward to studying.
      I am definitely glad that most of my exams are not cumulative, but I would prefer if they were scheduled during
      finals week. That would give me those few precious days of no class to study.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will complete the last phase of the project with my group. We are presenting on Friday, which I am
      actually grateful for. This means we'll be done early and I'll have more time to study for my exams. I also have
      one final Computer Vision assignment that is due on the last week of school. Hopefully I can finish that next
      week as well.
    </p>

    <h2>What was your experience in learning about refactoring?</h2>
    <p>
      Refactoring can be difficult for me to wrap my mind around. I have to think pretty hard about the logic and
      reasoning behind each problem before I can start solving it. However, Professor Downing teaches in a very
      straightforward manner, which I enjoy. The HackerRank exercises also help with my understanding. I definitely
      need to review this material quite a bit before the exam.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      Recently I've learned to always search for functions or tools before implementing my own. For instance, with React,
      Python, and even Matlab, there are often components, functions, or libraries that do exactly what I need. This
      has saved me so much time with my assignments.
