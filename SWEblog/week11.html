    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I had a pretty busy week. I worked a lot on my fourth computer vision assignment. It was our most difficult
      assignment, and required plenty of math and tons of visits to office hours. I had to use a slip day on the
      assignment, but finally finished on Friday. I also worked a bit on our SWE website. Our group met up a few times
      this week, and we are making pretty good progress. I still have a lot to learn, so I'm working more this weekend.
      I also spent most of my Thursday night and Friday morning studying for my Biology exam on Friday. It was pretty
      tough, and I was in a time crunch. Hopefully the final will be better.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I don't have anything really in my way currently, but I know I have a lot of studying to do in the next few
      weeks. I have four exams on the last week of class, as none of my professors scheduled anything to be during
      actual finals week.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will finish up Phase III of our SWE website with my group and start my fifth computer vision
      assignment. I also have an International Business exam next Tuesday, but that shouldn't be too bad. I don't
      have too much planned for next week. Hopefully everything will go smoothly.
    </p>

    <h2>What was your experience in learning SQL?</h2>
    <p>
      I've never had any SQL experience prior to this class, but everything has been pretty smooth so far. I enjoy
      Professor Downing's teaching style. It's very straightforward and in-your-face. He covers several topics
      each class and moves rather quickly, so I need to spend time reviewing at home. I still need to become more
      comfortable with the different types of join as well as subqueries, but once I understand those I think I'll
      feel pretty good about my understanding.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      My dad works as a developer at an AR/VR company called Magic Leap, so I've been looking into VR and AR
      applications. Magic Leap's main product is a gaming headset that allows the user to interact with the
      space around them in 3D. For instance, if you are in a room with a couch, the headset scans the room
      and understands the surfaces of the couch and the ground. The user can place animated figures on top
      of the couch and on the ground, or any other surface it detects. The figures can also move behind
      objects. You can find more information <a href = "https://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-one">here</a>.
