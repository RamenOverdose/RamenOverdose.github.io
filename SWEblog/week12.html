    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      This week I spent quite a bit of time finishing IDB3. It took longer than I expected. Aside from that, I had a
      pretty average week. Classes began to feel longer though. I'm hitting the point in the semester where my motivation
      is beginning to dip. On Wednesday I attended AirBnb's event in the GDC. They went over some tips on how to get the
      most out of an internship and brought pretty good food. I leared that AirBnb has had about 500 million unique
      customers in its lifetime, which honestly blows my mind. I know they are a successful company, but did not
      expect that many users.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I have an International Business exam on Tuesday that I need to study for, and a Computer Vision assignment
      due on Friday. This Computer Vision assignment includes implementing some machine learning algorithms, which
      shouldn't be too bad. However, we have to use Matlab, which I am not a fan of.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will complete my Computer Vision assignment and start on the last phase of our SWE project. I'm
      pretty excited to finish up our website, but it'll probably take longer than I expect, like every phase has
      been so far. I also need to start getting ahead in Biology. It's the class I dislike the most and I definitely
      regret taking it. It's difficult for me to put effort into a subject I am not passionate about.
    </p>

    <h2>What was your experience of Project #4: IDB3?</h2>
    <p>
      This phase took much longer than I expected. We started early and had pretty much all the functionalities complete
      by Tuesday, but did not realize that the technical report and unit tests would take as long as they did. We also
      had some formatting issues that needed to be fixed, and realized last minute that we needed an extra filter
      on our third model. On Thursday we spent six hours in the PCL, which I was not prepared for. We turned in the
      assignment at 9:50, but everything ended up working and I am pretty happy about our website.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      I encountered a small CSS problem when I was working with React this week. I wanted to change an attribute
      of an HTML element upon hover of a different HTML element. I could not change CSS, so I used "document.getElementById"
      in JavaScript alongside the "onMouseOver" HTML attribute, which allows the program to find a specified HTML element.
      I wanted to change the "src" attribute, so my method ended up being "document.getElementById.src = ...". I was
      also worried about the efficiency of this method versus CSS, but apparently getElementById is very quick.
