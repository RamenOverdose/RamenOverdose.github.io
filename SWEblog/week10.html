    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I had a pretty average week in terms of school. I started my fourth computer vision assignment and worked
      on Phase III of our SWE project. This phase is a little easier than last phase because there are not as many
      new features to implement. We're focusing mainly on refining our CSS and instance data. <br><br>

      This week I also found out that my car battery died, so I couldn't start my car. I had to ask a friend for a
      jump, and was able to get my battery replaced at Autozone. On Saturday I attended Forty Acres Fest and tabled
      for Texas Electronic Music Club. We had a pretty good time promoting the club. We had a tri-fold poster, some
      t-shirts, and stickers.

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I have a Biology exam this Friday, which I really need to study for. We learned quite a bit these past few weeks,
      so I am pretty worried about this exam. I'm also bothered by the way my Biology class is structured. The first two
      exams of the class each covered three chapters. This upcoming exam covers four chapters. After this exam, we have
      five more chapters to cover before the final. I feel like too much information is being crammed into the last month
      of the class, and should have been split more evenly.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will study for my biology exam, finish my computer vision assignment, and hopefully have most of
      Phase III done for SWE. I am also going on a camping trip at Pace Bend Park over the weekend. I want to sleep
      in my car rather than a tent, so I need to make sure my car is equipped with everything I'll need. That means
      buying food, bug nets, and some other accessories. This will be a pretty busy week, but I'm sure if I plan things
      out it won't be too bad.

    <h2>What did you think of the talk by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline?</h2>
    <p>
      I thought their talk was very interesting, as ethics is a topic I rarely think about. As programmers, it is
      so easy for us to get caught up in the code that we forget about the purpose of our work. It was refreshing
      to think about such ethical dilemmas, and it's important to remember that technology is both beneficial
      and dangerous.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      AWS has a service called CodePipeline, which is a continuous integration and continuous delivery service
      that allows a project to be updated, built, and tested automatically before deployment. It may not be
      worth it for smaller projects, but can make the deployment process for larger projects much more efficient.
      You can define the build and testing stages as you wish, and there is an option to have the pipeline
      deploy automatically or have the user deploy manually.
