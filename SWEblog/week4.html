    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I had a pretty rough week. My Collatz assignment as well as my first Computer Vision project were
      both due. I spent around 20 hours on Collatz and probably almost 30 hours on Computer Vision. I
      started early though, which definitely helped. I actually found my Vision project to be rather
      interesting. We used Matlab to create a seam carving algorithm, which basically takes an image and
      removes the parts it deems "less important". For instance, If a person is on the left side of the
      frame and another person is on the right side of the frame, the algorithm will usually take out the
      middle section of the image and connect the two sides back together, creating a smaller yet more
      interesting image. I also had a Biology exam on Friday. It was more detailed than I expected, so
      I'll need to study more in the future.

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I am attending the FoCS event on Wednesday. I still need to update my resume and print some out. I'm
      currently a Junior, but I'm looking for full time positions at this event. Hopefully it's not too early
      for that. I also have an International Business exam on Tuesday that I need to study for. I'll be doing
      plenty of reading this weekend.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will attend the FoCS event and possibly career fair. I want to get started on the next
      Computer Vision assignment as well. The last assignment took longer than expected, so I am glad I
      started early. I'll be attending class and doing homework as usual. I will be paying closer attention
      in Biology. The exam was pretty tough, but now I know what to look out for and what the professor thinks
      is important.

    <h2>What was your experience of Project #1?</h2>
    <p>
      I found it to be pretty average. The instructions were pretty straightforward for the most part, and the
      programming was not too bad. I am glad that there were plenty of office hours available, especially
      the lab hours. All the TA's are very helpful and considerate. However, the project did take longer than
      I expected. I estimated 15 hours, and thought that was an overestimate, but turns out I spent about
      20 hours total. Fixing pylint issues and adding the unit/acceptance tests took a decent chunk of time.
      I'm glad this was our first project. Now I understand the workflow that we go through in this class, and
      what Professor Downing expects from us in the future.

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      Pramp is an online mock interview service for software engineers who want to practice their interviewing
      skills. It is peer-to-peer, which means that you are matched with somebody else with similar preferences.
      You both interview each other through video, so you get to experience both sides. It's a great way to
      practice. You can find more information <a href = "https://www.pramp.com/#/">here</a>.
