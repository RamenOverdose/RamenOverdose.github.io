    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I had a pretty tough International Business exam on Tuesday. I didn't do well, but we get a dropped exam,
      so I'm fine with it. I studied for that exam on Monday and Tuesday. For the rest of the week, up until
      Friday night, I worked on IDB2 with my group. We had a lot of ground to cover, as we barely worked during
      Spring Break. We realized this was a mistake when it was Thursday night and we didn't even have a working website.
      There were so many random technical issues popping up with AWS and our API. We were feeling pretty discouraged
      until somebody asked for an extension on Piazza, and it was actually granted. We could not believe it. By the
      time we turned the project in on Friday, we felt a bit better. We are very thankful for the extension.

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I have my fourth computer vision assignment due next week. It's a really long assignment, so I need to get
      started early and make sure I understand all the concepts. I've also had trouble with wasting food lately.
      Last weekend I bought groceries, but I was only able to use a little more than a half of what I purchased
      because I was so busy last week. When I buy groceries, I need to think about my week ahead to make sure
      I have time to cook.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      My upcoming week seems pretty average. I'll be working mainly on my fourth computer vision assignment.
      I need to catch up on studying for biology as well. I have an officer meeting on Wednesday for Texas
      Electronic Music Club. We have a campout and a boat party that we need to plan.
    </p>

    <h2>What was your experience of Project #3: IDB2?</h2>
    <p>
      This phase was very difficult for our group. We had trouble with pretty much every part of the project.
      We also didn't do much over spring break, which was a mistake. We had to ask so many questions throughout
      the week, and attended every office hour available, which helped a lot. We had to change several of our
      implementations from the previous phase, which was frustrating. Seeding the database, API calls, and AWS
      gave us tons of problems. There were so many separate components that were interdependent. We did not
      have a working website until Friday morning. We are grateful for the extension and all the help from the TA's.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      Our group had trouble with multiple CSS files affecting our project in this phase. One CSS file would
      sometimes override another CSS file, and we could not figure out why that was happening. Although we did
      not fully understand the issue. I found a "duct tape" fix that works alright. After a line of CSS, you can
      add "!important" before the semicolon, which allows this CSS command to be treated as a priority.
      For instance, "color: white !important;" will ensure that your font is white.
