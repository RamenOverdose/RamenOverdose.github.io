    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      This past week I finished up the last phase of the project with my group. We were presenting on Friday,
      so we had to do all six visualizations by then. The visualizations were a bit harder than we expected.
      JavaScript gave us quite a few problems. We had race conditions when it came to setting state variables.
      We had to duct tape some of our code to fix this issue, but it all worked out in the end. We practiced our
      presentation a few times on Thursday night, and practiced one last time right before class. The presentation
      ended up going pretty smoothly, even though we had to cut out some parts of it due to the time constraint.

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I have four exams this upcoming week, which is a bit stressful. I've been studying all weekend, but it's
      still difficult to juggle four exams at once. I have to rotate between studying each subject in two hour
      chunks. I wish my Biology exam was actually scheduled during finals week. Even though I'll be done with the
      semester after this week, I would prefer to have those extra days to study. <br><br>

      Recently I've also realized that there are so many interesting classes that UT has to offer. I'm a little
      upset that I don't have the time to take everything I want. If it were up to me, I would take an extra
      semester just to take some cool classes outside the CS department.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      I'll be stuyding and taking my exams. There's nothing else I have my mind on. I just want to get through
      this week without having to worry too much about my grades.
    </p>

    <h2>What did you think of the talk by Miriam?</h2>
    <p>
      I thought her talk was important. Women are indeed underrepresented in the tech field, and it's necessary
      to be cognizant of this and other issues that surround the workplace. These topics can be difficult to discuss
      because there are not many "numbers" or "statistics" to look at, but she explained it in a straightforward and
      organized manner.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      When working with JavaScript state variables in React, sometimes they will not update before the page is loaded.
      I found a duct tape way to fix this, which forces the component to render. This is definitely not the "right"
      way to fix the problem, but can be useful in emergencies. "this.forceUpdate()" forces a rerender and will allow
      the state variable to be set.
