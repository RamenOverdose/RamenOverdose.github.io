    <h2>The Ethical Software Engineer: The Suggestion Box</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Given this conflict, I would rather not determine the identity of the alleged saboteur. <br><br>

      When a company makes a promise to its employees or its customers, it should do everything in its power
      to keep that promise. This is not only a matter of ethics, but also culture. When a promise is broken towards
      employees, there would be a decrease in trust towards management and the company culture would change dramatically.
      In the case of The Suggestion Box problem, the president is effectively saying that he places the performance
      of his company over the well-being of his employees. I do not find that effective for solving problems nor
      productive for the health of the company. An anonymous feedback program is in place so employees can voice their
      concerns without fear of retaliation. This allows honest feedback to occur and gives management a relatively
      accurate understanding of how employees feel about their job. If this privacy were to be taken away without
      notice, employees would no longer provide honest feedback. This lack of trust could also carry over to other
      aspects of the company. Employees may no longer believe that their future in the company is certain. They might
      become wary of the president's other policies. If I were to identify the alleged saboteur, all of these things
      would most likely occur. Instead, it would be more professional and ethical for the president to address the issue
      publicly, towards all the company's employees. This way, he can prove that he cares about the performance of the
      company while maintaining the relationships and trust of his employees. <br><br>

      The saboteur's actions are most likely unethical and may cost the company quite a bit of resources. However, this
      does not mean that the company also has to retaliate in an unethical manner. When a company proves itself to be
      trustworthy, it will benefit in the long run, as the employees who comprise a company are just as important as the
      company itself. Additionally, it is the company's responsibility to review each employee's work. An employee should
      not have the ability to manufacture a product that is defective at such a high frequency. The resources and capital
      that the company loses from the sabotage can be replaced, but broken trust is much more difficult to repair. <br><br>

      That being said, in some circumstances, it would be best for the company to identify the employee. Let's assume that
      the employee works at a car manufacturer, and retaliates by removing the driver-side airbag in every ten production
      vehicles. Over the course of a year, the employee will have removed airbags from thousands of vehicles. Now, consumers
      are driving vehicles that are not equipped with enough safety equipment. Let's say that people who purchase cars from
      this manufacturer begin to report injuries from car accidents. They say that their airbag did not deploy at all.
      Over time, deaths may even arise from this issue. Now, the company has no choice but to identify the person
      who is sabotaging its vehicles. In this case, employees would most likely understand that the situation is dire.
      There is no excuse for loss of human life when it can be prevented.
