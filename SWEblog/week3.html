    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      This past week I had a pretty normal schedule. I went to class and did my homework as usual.
      I started on the Collatz project and finished most of my Computer Vision project. I'm beginning
      to get used to Matlab, which is what we use in Vision. I'm also learning more about Python and
      GitLab through SWE. I attended Texas Electronic Music Club's second general meeting and also worked
      on the website with a fellow officer. I also finally got around to sending my transcript from ACC
      to UT. Now I can register a bit earlier, as I covered all six hours of government at ACC. Hopefully
      this also gives me more space in my schedule next year to take some classes I actually enjoy.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I have my Collatz assignment and my second Computer Vision assignment due at the end of this week.
      I also have my first Biology exam this Friday. It's a pretty busy week for me, so I need to prioritize
      my commitments and make the most out of my time. I often waste the few hours between my morning and afternoon
      classes, so I need to stop doing that and use it to study. One small yet important thing I am working on is
      reducing my caffeine intake. I try not to exceed 300 mg of caffeine per day, but sometimes I go over.
      I need to force myself to drink less coffee so I don't become overly dependent.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will be doing quite a bit of studying. I will attend lab session for this class on Tuesday.
      I find it to be very helpful. The student to TA ratio has been pretty low, but I'm guessing that there
      will be more people as the deadline approaches. I will also attend two Biology review sessions
      for my exam on Friday. I'm going to turn in my Computer Vision assignment pretty soon, and will work on
      the Collatz project throughout the week. I need to update my resume for the FoCS event and the career fair,
      both of which occur two weeks from now.
    </p>

    <h2>What was your experience of learning the basics of Python?</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoyed learning Python in this course, as Professor Downing creates well-organized and structured
      lessons. They are interactive as well, which helps my understanding. I do not have much experience with
      Python, so I have learned quite a bit so far. I also enjoy the way Professor Downing draws parallels
      between Python and Java.

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS and Linux. It makes installing missing packages very easy.
      Everything can be done through the command line. For instance, if you want to update git, you can simply
      enter "brew upgrade git" and git will update automatically. If you have MacOS, you should check it out.
      You can find more information <a href = "https://brew.sh/">here</a>.
