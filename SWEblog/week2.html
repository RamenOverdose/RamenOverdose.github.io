    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
    I got to understand my classes much better this week. I sunk into my school routine, and am glad
    to be back in the rhythm of things. I finished my first Computer Vision assignment, which was basically
    a mini Matlab tutorial. I also learned some of the nuances behind Python through SWE. One of the
    things I enjoy most about pursuing a CS degree is that the skills I acquire are tangible. Once I've
    learned parts of a new tool or a new language, I can immediately apply my knowledge. On a different
    note, I cooked three times this past week, which is a big accomplishment for me.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
    I need to read more for pretty much all of my classes. It's the easiest way for me to develop an
    understanding of the material, so I should spend more time reading. There is so much to learn, especially
    in this class. I have plenty of research to do. <br><br>
    I am also working on cooking more. Chipotle is beginning to get boring, so I need to widen my range of
    dishes at home.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
    I will continue to focus on my classes. I will work on the project for this class as well as my
    second Computer Vision assignment. I also need to transfer my credits from ACC to UT. I took both Texas
    and US Government at ACC over the past two summers, so I need to get those credits transferred before
    registration. I have my second Texas Electronic Music Club meeting on Wednesday. We are currently working
    on creating merch and organizing events. I am responsible for building the website and managing our
    social media. On Thursday, I am attending a dinner hosted by Nvidia, the company I am interning
    at this summer.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your experience of the in-class exercises?</h2>
    <p>
    I find the in-class exercises to be very organized and straightforward. This does not mean
    I always understand everything, but rather the progression of exercises is structured well. Professor
    Downing also takes organized notes, which makes studying easier at home.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
    A Cloud Guru is an online program that is dedicated to teaching everything about the cloud, and especially
    Amazon Web Services. It consists of hundreds of videos that mainly focus on material found in cloud
    certification exams. You can purchase individual courses or pay a price for unlimited access. Yes, it is
    not free, but in the case that you want a structured program to practice for your cloud certification exam,
    or simply want to learn AWS quickly, A Cloud Guru is a great resource. You can find them

    I hope that didn't sound too much like an ad.
