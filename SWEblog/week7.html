    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I worked on the project with my team at the beginning of this week, and we were pretty productive. We finished
      up everything that was due on Tuesday, and even did a little extra on the front-end portion. For the rest of my
      week I focused on my Computer Vision assignment, which was due Friday. It was pretty tough. It involved
      circle-detection using two methods, Hough Transform and RANSAC. I was not aware Computer Vision was a project and
      programming heavy class, so this assignment caught me by surprise. I ended up finishing though, albeit with
      not much time to spare. <br><br>

      On Wednesday we had a general meeting for Texas Electronic Music Club. Our turnout was pretty low, but that's
      because we didn't reach out much this week. We had just wrapped up a huge event last Saturday, which was a
      major success. I'm glad the club is thriving and that I get to be a part of its growth.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I have three exams next week on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I have a lot of studying to do this weekend,
      which I am not particularly looking forward to. I thought I would have the chance to study this past week, but
      I had to focus on my Computer Vision assignment. I feel like I'm already behind. Hopefully I can gain some
      confidence this weekend.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      I'll most likely be studying all of next week. However, there is a march for public education at the Capitol
      on Monday. I'm a photographer, and I love photographing protests, especially those that I relate to.
      I believe public education is underfunded and crucial to the development of our country. I would love to go
      support the teachers, instructors, and educators there, but I am not sure I'll have enough time. For now,
      my goal is simply to get through next week and feel secure about my exam performances once Spring Break arrives.
      I'll probably also find some time to work on the next section of our project for this class.

    <h2>What was your experience of Project #2: IDB1?</h2>
    <p>
      Despite having to spend a ton of time on Google, I enjoyed the process. I learned a substantial amount, especially
      with regard to React and Bootstrap. I was also responsible for handling the AWS side of the project. I had a decent
      amount of experience with AWS, but was still able to learn quite a bit in these last few weeks. However, AWS can
      get frustrating very quickly. Amazon's documentation is not the most intuitive, and I often had trouble deciphering
      their vague instructions. I was also glad to have learned some more Git. The more I use it, the more I find
      Git to be absolutely genius. Overall, I enjoyed this project. The next assignment seems much harder, but I am grateful
      to have learned this much already.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      I've been really enjoying Atom lately. It may not have the most features compared to other IDE's, but it
      is more than enough for what I do and has a beautiful user interface. It also integrates with Git, which
      can be super useful at times. For instance, when I was working on last project, I had a merge conflict when
      I was pulling code. Atom showed me where the merge conflicts were and integrated it into the UI by displaying
      my version and the repository's version side by side. It then let me select which one I wanted to keep.
      Merge conflicts don't happen often, but I was glad Atom allowed me to resolve mine quickly.
