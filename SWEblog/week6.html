    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I started working on the project for this class with my group. I spent quite a bit of time by myself
      learning bootstrap and react. I also had to learn how to set up an S3 bucket, what a RESTful API is,
      and what HTTPS means. There have been too many google searches this past week. I've learned to be
      grateful for living in the age where information is so easily accessible. I've also learned some more
      about Git. The person who developed Git is a genius.
      <br><br>
      I also started on my third Computer Vision assignment. We are working on object detection using two
      methods. One is called Hough Transform and the other is called RANSAC. I'm still don't understand the
      algorithms that well, so I need to brush up on those concepts.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I have three exams on the week before spring break. They are on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Even
      though that is two weeks from now, I need to begin studying for them. I know I won't have enough energy
      to study that much when the time actually comes.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will finish the project for this class. We have to work quite a bit this weekend, as we did
      not realize we needed to use React until this past Thursday. We almost had to rewrite our entire website,
      which has taken a significant amount of time. I will also finish my Computer Vision assignment, which is
      due on Friday. I'm going to begin studying Biology pretty early, as the second midterm is
      approaching quickly, and we've covered a ton of material in the past few weeks.

    <h2>What did you think of the talk by Jesse on security?</h2>
    <p>
      I found his talk to be rather interesting, as I do not have any experience with security. His presentation
      was pretty organized, but I had trouble following some parts of it. For instance, when he explained the
      vulnerabilities of having a phone number being saved as a number, I did not understand the reasoning behind it.
      He then explained how an attacker could change it to be saved as a string, or vice versa. I didn't catch
      the significance of it.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      I recently learned the mechanics behind Git's commit and push functionalities. When I commit a change, Git
      saves that update in my local repository. When I push, Git updates the remote repository with the latest
      commit that I made. Then, the head is updated to point to this latest commit. I had previously never visualized
      commits as a chain, with a head pointer that can move around. When I switch to a branch, the head pointer also
      moves to that new branch. Visualizing these pointers made Git more interesting to me.
