    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>I finalized my schedule and simply went through the motions of school. I'm trying to get back
    in the rhythm of things, but I feel pretty comfortable for now. I've also been playing the PS4 and
    hanging out with friends. I'm making an effort to cook more this semester. Last semester I spent
    too much money eating out. Hopefully pasta, fried rice, and dumplings don't get too boring.</p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>My work ethic falters sometimes, which I am not too happy about. I let myself get complacent
    about things too often, whether it's homework, learning, or even cooking. I want to work on that
    this semester and push myself harder. I also have much to learn in terms of software engineering,
    so I will definitely be doing my research this semester.</p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>Next week I will continue to go to class. I have a computer vision assignment due on Tuesday, which
    I will be working on. I will attend Texas Electronic Music Club's second meeting this semester. I am
    the photographer for the club, and will take officer headshots for them on Wednesday. In my free time,
    I want to continue practicing my programming skills through Leetcode. I've also been going through a React
    tutorial, and I will finish that this upcoming week. I might apply to a part-time job at UT to earn a
    couple bucks on the side.</p>

    <h2>What are your expectations of the class?</h2>
    <p>I expect to learn plenty of new software development tools and figure out how to use them through trial
    and error. I'll probably find many of my questions answered through StackOverflow, online articles, and even
    Youtube tutorials. I expect this course to be challenging and involving. I am currently under the impression
    that I'll learn more from this course than any other course I have taken before, so I am both a little
    nervous and excited to move forward.</p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>Golang has a built-in testing package which makes running tests very efficient and easy to understand.
    If you want to test a file named "hello.go", you can simply create a test file named "hello_test.go", and
    Golang will understand that this is a test file. Once you have written your tests, which must
    follow certain naming conventions, you can simply execute "go test" and the tests will run. On top of this,
    Golang can also provide you with a code coverage report that is displayed in an html page for easy reading.
    You can find more information <a href = "https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">here</a>.</p>
