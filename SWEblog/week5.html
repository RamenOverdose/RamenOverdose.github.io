    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I had an International Business exam on Tuesday, which went pretty well. I studied pretty much all of Monday
      night and Tuesday morning. I didn't feel the most prepared, but did better than I expected. The first exam
      of each course I take is always a learning experience. I get a good feel for what the professor expects
      and what he or she believes is important. It allows me to perform better on future exams. On Wednesday I
      attended the FoCS event. I went in search of full time offers, but only talked to a few companies. I am
      currently a Junior, so most of them told me they would reach out closer to the fall. The food at the event
      was also surprisingly delicious.
      <br><br>
      Last week I also spent a good amount of time brainstorming project ideas with my SWE group. We eventually
      settled on the idea of natural disaster relief. Professor Downing approved of our idea, which was a major
      milestone. Brainstorming was more time-consuming than we all expected.

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      I took a Biology exam two Fridays ago, which didn't go so smoothly. I realized that the exams go into
      pretty serious detail, which I did not expect. I have a plethora of concepts I need to understand
      for the next exam, but I am pretty confident in my abilities to bounce back.
      <br><br>
      I have also had trouble installing Matlab due to the poor internet connection in my apartment. Matlab
      contains a massive amount of data. Even with a decent connection, it will probably take around thirty
      minutes to install. I need to go on campus for better wifi.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      Next week I will be working on the SWE project with my group. We're going to design the website as well
      as the RESTful API. I'm also going to begin my third Computer Vision assignment and complete my biology
      homework. It'll be a pretty average week.
    </p>

    <h2>What did you think of the talk by Ed on GCP and Hannah on AWS?</h2>
    <p>
      I thought they were both organized and informative. I'm glad that we were able to receive tutorials
      on a few tools. It makes both GCP and AWS a little less intimidating. Our group ended up choosing AWS,
      simply because a few of us have experience with it.

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      Git has a function called patch, which lets you create a patch file specifying the changes to perform
      on another file. The patch file can be applied to the original file, which will update to include the
      patch. You can also revert a patch. This way, instead of having two versions of the same file, you can
      simply have one version and a small patch file. Patches are also used when somebody who does not have
      read or write access to a repository wants to make a change. They can simply send a patch file to the
      owners of the code, who can then apply the patch. You can find more information
