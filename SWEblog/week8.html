    <h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
    <p>
      I had a really rough week. I had a computer vision exam on Wednesday, the exam for this class on Thursday,
      and a biology exam on Friday. I pretty much spent my entire week studying.By the time Thursday night hit,
      I barely had any motivation to look at Biology. Computer vision required more studying than I expected.
      That class took up my entire Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning. My biology professor also had
      the audacity to assign a worksheet that was due Friday night. Overall, I think my exam performances were just
      about average. Even though I could have done better, I am happy with my scheduling and time usage this past
      week.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in your way?</h2>
    <p>
      Our group needs to begin working on Project #3 pretty badly. I will be working on it for the first half of
      Spring Break, but I have travel plans on Wednesday. I have a lot to learn in terms of the API. I also have
      an exam on the Tuesday after Spring Break, so I need to study for that as well. I'll probably just set aside
      a few hours every day and I'll be good.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you do next week?</h2>
    <p>
      I'll catch up on sleep, watch Youtube videos, and hang out with friends. I'm also going to work on the SWE
      project and study for my International Business exam next Tuesday. On Wednesday, I am going to the Smoky
      Mountains with my girlfriend. We're going hiking for a few days and coming back Saturday night. It's a short
      trip, but it will be a great break. Additionally, I am very excited to finally have the chance to wash my car.
      I have an outside parking spot under a tree in West Campus. My car is always covered with leaves and bird
      poop, which is not only disgusting, but also bad for the paint. Now that I'm living with my parents during the
      break, I'll have the chance to clean all the dried up bird droppings from my car.
    </p>

    <h2>What was your experience of Test #1?</h2>
    <p>
      It was pretty close to what I expected, but I ran out of time. Some instructions also confused me a little bit.
      I spent more time than I should have on the easy problems, so I ran out of time on the harder ones that were
      worth more points. I probably did a little below average on this exam. I realized I should have put more python
      documentation on my cheat sheet, and still need more practice with python. However, now I understand where my
      weaknesses are, and can build upon them to do better on the next exam.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h2>
    <p>
      Honestly, Youtube has probably been the easiest way for me to learn any concept related to computer science
      this year. Whether it was for algorithms, data mining, computer vision, or software engineering, Youtube
      has probably taught me 60% of the knowledge I needed for exams and assignments. There are so many videos
      on almost every concept, and if you find a video that clicks with you, you will be able to understand
      something in less than ten minutes. Hopefully in the future I can give back and make some videos of my own.
