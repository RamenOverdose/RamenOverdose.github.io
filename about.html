		Welcome! My name is Allen Wang and I am a photographer based in Austin, Texas. I have been in the industry for a little
	   over three years now, and can say that this is one of my true passions. I have done photography for various occasions,
	   from formal portraits and social gatherings to sports events and car shows. This has been an amazing journey so far,
	   and I could not be more excited to continue my career doing something I absolutely love.<br><br>
	
	   Automobiles have always been special to me. I have been photographing cars for as long as I can remember, and have
	   seen almost everything, from Japanese imports to Italian supercars. I cannot tell you how blessed I am to be able
	   to pursue both of my passions in my career, and am always on the lookout for the next big car show. I hope you
	   enjoy my images, and as always, here's to burning rubber and clicking shutters.
