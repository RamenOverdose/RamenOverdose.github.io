    Welcome! My name is Allen Wang and I am a photographer based in Austin, Texas. I have been in the industry for a little
    over three years now, and can say that this is one of my true passions. I have done photography for various occasions,
    from formal portraits and social gatherings to sports events and car shows. This has been an amazing journey so far,
    and I could not be more excited to continue doing something I absolutely love.<br><br>

    I am currently a full time student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am studying computer science, and hope to
    pursue both software development and photography after college.
